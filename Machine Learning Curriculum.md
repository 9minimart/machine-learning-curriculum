# Machine Learning Curriculum
Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence dedicated at making machines learn from observational data without being explicitly programmed.

This is a really big list because I also point to other people's list to ensure that most of the resources are accessible from this page without you looking anywhere else.

**NOTE**: There is no particular rank or order for each link. The order in which they appear does not convey any meaning and is not essential.
