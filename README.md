# Machine Learning Curriculum

Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence dedicated at making machines learn from observational data without being explicitly programmed.

Let sacrifice some time to learn Machine Learning so that you can be lazy later.

## Disclaimer

This is a really big list because I also point to other people's list to ensure that most of the resources are accessible from this page without you looking anywhere else.

**NOTE**: There is no particular rank for each link. The order in which they appear does not convey any meaning and should not be treated differently.

## General Machine Learning

A computer program is said to learn from experience `E` with respect to some
class of tasks `T` and performance measure `P` if its performance at tasks in
`T`, as measured by `P`, improves with experience `E`.
