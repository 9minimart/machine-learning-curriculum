# Machine Learning Curriculum

Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence dedicated at making machines learn from observational data without being explicitly programmed.

Let sacrifice some time to learn Machine Learning so that you can be lazy later.

## Disclaimer

This is a really big list because I also point to other people's list to ensure that most of the resources are accessible from this page without you looking anywhere else.

**NOTE**: There is no particular rank for each link. The order in which they appear does not convey any meaning and should not be treated differently.

## Machine Learning in General

A computer program is said to learn from experience `E` with respect to some
class of tasks `T` and performance measure `P` if its performance at tasks in
`T`, as measured by `P`, improves with experience `E`.

### Convolutional Neural Networks
DNNs that work with grid data like sound waveforms, images and videos better
than ordinary DNNs. They are based on the assumptions that nearby input units
are more related than the distant units. They also utilize translation
invariance. For example, given an image, it might be useful to detect the same
kind of edges everywhere on the image.
They are sometimes called **convnets** or **CNNs**.

### Recurrent Neural Networks

DNNs that have states. They also understand sequences that vary in length.
They are sometimes called **RNNs**.
